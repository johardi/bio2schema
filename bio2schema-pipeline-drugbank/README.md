# Schema.org Transformation for DrugBank Data

This folder contains a data transformation pipeline that will transform [DrugBank](https://www.drugbank.ca) data into Schema.org's structure.

The pipeline will transform the original data format from XML to JSON-LD following the [Drug](https://health-lifesci.schema.org/Drug) specification. Additionally, the pipeline will reconcile names with known LOD databases (e.g., DBpedia and BioPortal) to find their persistent identifier and preferred name so that it is possible to link the information with other well-known resources.

## Data Mapping

The table below shows the data mapping used to transform DrugBank XML data to Schema.org specification.
* The `Schema.org Data Element` column shows the data field name in the Schema.org specification
* The `DrugBank Data Element` column shows the XML path to denote the source value
* The `Type` column indicates the data type used to encapsulate the value
* The `Cardinality` column indicates the data structure used to store the value (i.e., 1 = a single value, * = an array, 1..* = either a single value or an array).
* Lastly, the `Note` column describes some additional information regarding the data transformation

| Schema.org Data Element | DrugBank Data Element | Type | Cardinality | Notes
--- | --- | :---: | :---: | ---
`identifier` | `/cas-number`,<br/>`/unii` | [PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue) | * |
`name` | `/name` | String | 1 | An entity reconciler will be used to get the medical code via [BioPortal search service](http://data.bioontology.org/documentation#nav_search)
`description` | `/description` | String | 1 |
`alternateName` | `/synonyms/synonym` | String | * |
`drugClass` | `/classification/direct-parent` | String | 1 |
`activeIngredient` | `/salts/salt` | String | * |
`proprietaryName` | `/international_brands/international_brand` | String | * |
`clinicalPharmacology` | `/absorption`,<br/>`/metabolism`,<br/>`/route-of-elimination`,<br/>`/half-life`,<br/>`/clearance`,<br/>`/volume-of-distribution`,<br/>`/affected-organism`,<br/>`/pharmacodynamics` | String | * |
`mechanismOfAction` | `/mechanism-of-action` | String | 1 |
`overdosage` | `/toxicity` | String | 1 |
`labelDetails` | `/fda-label` | URL | 1 |
`foodWarning` | `/food-interactions/food-interaction` | String | * |
`warning` | `/indication` | String | 1 |
`interactingDrug` | `/drug-interactions/drug-interaction` | [Drug](https://health-lifesci.schema.org/Drug) | * | A persistent identifier will be included to refer to an existing resource
`sameAs` | `/external-links/external-link` | URL | * |
`subjectOf` | `/general-references/articles` | [MedicalScholarlyArticle](https://health-lifesci.schema.org/MedicalScholarlyArticle) | * | A persistent identifier will be included to refer to an existing resource

We implemented the data mapping using the [JSLT](https://github.com/schibsted/jslt) syntax and you can find the detail in _./src/main/resources/drugbank.jslt_ file.

## Example Output

The example below shows the result of executing the pipeline against a data record for [Mafenide](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB06795) in the DrugBank site.
