# Bio2Schema

## Overview
The Bio2Schema Project makes public health data on the Web available in [schema.org](https://schema.org/) format.

In this pilot project, we transform data records from 3 public data repositories:
1. [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)
2. [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)
3. [DrugBank](https://www.drugbank.ca/)

to types in schema.org which are [MedicalTrial](https://health-lifesci.schema.org/MedicalTrial), [MedicalScholarlyArticle](https://health-lifesci.schema.org/MedicalScholarlyArticle), and [Drug](https://health-lifesci.schema.org/Drug), respectively.
