      The aim of the study was to describe the safety and immunogenicity of the 2017-2018
      formulation of Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine in children 6 months to &lt; 9 years of age, and in
      adults 18 to &lt; 65 years of age, and to describe the safety and immunogenicity of the
      2017-2018 formulation of Fluzone High-Dose vaccine in adults ≥ 65 years of age.

      All participants received 1 intramuscular dose of their assigned vaccine during Visit 1. For
      participants, for whom 2 doses of influenza vaccine were recommended per Advisory Committee
      on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidance, a second dose of the same volume as the first dose
      was administered during Visit 2 (28 days after Visit 1). Solicited adverse reaction (AR)
      information was collected for 7 days following each vaccination. Unsolicited non-serious
      adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) information was collected from Visit 1 to
      Visit 2 or from Visit 1 to Visit 3 for those participants receiving 2 doses of study vaccine.

      Immunogenicity was evaluated in all participants prior to vaccination on Day 0 (Visit 1) and
      after the final vaccination (Day 28 post-final vaccination for participants 6 months to &lt; 9
      years of age and Day 21 post-vaccination for participants ≥ 18 years of age).

             Information for each study vaccine.

          -  Thrombocytopenia, which may be a contraindication for intramuscular vaccination, at
             the discretion of the Investigator.

          -  Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion,
             contraindicating intramuscular vaccination.

          -  Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator judgment) on the
             day of planned vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 100.4 degree Fahrenheit
             [°F] [38.0 degrees Celsius {°C}]). A prospective participant should not be included in
             the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided.

          -  Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with
             direct involvement in the proposed study (participants ≥ 18 years of age) or
             identified as an immediate family member (i.e., parent, spouse, natural or adopted
             child) of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study
             (all participants).
